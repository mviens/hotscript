Differences in 1.20160403.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - CHANGE: Win-Pause was incorrectly wrapped by the "enableHkMisc" variable.  If this variable was disabled, the
              Win-Pause key (which pauses HotScript) would not be enabled. This is the only hotkey that is hard-coded and
              cannot be user-modified. While the Win-Pause key may be overridden but some other function, it is not
              (currently) possible to reassign HotScript's pause function to another key combination due to the
              restrictions of AHK's "Suspend" command.
HotStrings
    - CHANGE: Changed the auto-correct HotString of "cL" to now include all drive letters.
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Added a link on the help screen to open the HotScript home page in the default browser.
    - NEW   : Added an option on the tray icon to display the help screen.
    - CHANGE: Refactored all internal HotStrings to use hotString() instead of the mechanism used by AHK. This will
              help with some future changes as well as reducing the amount of code. It should now be possible to define
              any HotString using hotString(), which can have much more flexibility than offered by AHK. I strongly
              recommend comverting your existing user-defined HotStrings to use this new method. When using hotScript(),
              addHotString() no longer needs to be called to update the metrics.
    - CHANGE: Rearranged the help screen for HotStrings.
    - CHANGE: Trying to fix a bug when showing the help screen. Randomly the screen will show without the text displayed.
              If you click and drag with the mouse, the text will show. Still working on this issue, but it seems
              "better".
Variables
    - NEW   : Added "replaceMode" to "hs.const" object.
    - CHANGE: Made the $ variable to be truly global.  Do NOT use this variable name for your own values.

    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - getIndent()
                - getIndent1()

                - hsHtmlHtml()
                - hsHtmlInput()
                - hsHtmlLink()
                - hsHtmlList()
                - hsHtmlOptGroup()
                - hsHtmlSelect()
                - hsHtmlSource()
                - hsHtmlStyle()
                - hsHtmlTable()
                - hsHtmlTagAbbr()
                - hsHtmlTagBlock()
                - hsHtmlTagFor()
                - hsHtmlTagNoEndChar()
                - hsHtmlTagSimple()
                - hsHtmlTagSrc()
                - hsHtmlTextarea()
                - hsHtmlTr()
                - hsJiraCode()
                - hsJiraColor()
                - hsJiraNoFormat()
                - hsJiraPanel()
                - hsJiraQuote()
                - hsJiraSpecialPanel()
                - hsJiraTable()
                - hsJira()
    - CHANGE: Swapped position of "clear" and "condition" in the function defintion of hotString().
    - CHANGE: Renamed "hsBackInX()" to "hsAliasBackInX()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "sendJiraCode()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "sendJiraPanel()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "sendJiraSpecialPanel()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "templateJiraTable()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Minor change to prepended text for debug().
    - REMOVE: Removed obsolete function hkToStr().


Differences in 1.20160326.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-C to copy/append text to the clipboard. This does NOT work for files.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-V to swap the currently selected text into the clipboard, replacing the selected text with
              the previous contents of the clipboard.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-X to cut/append text to the clipboard. This does NOT work for files.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Win-Arrow to move the current window to the edge of the screen, without resizing it.
    - NEW   : Added Win-M to run Character Map.
    - NEW   : Added Alt-Win-H to run Windows Explorer in the HotScript folder.
    - NEW   : Added Alt-Win-S to run Windows Explorer in the Startup folder.
    - NEW   : Added Win-` to run DebugView.
    - CHANGE: Modified the HotKeys for dragging the mouse from CtrlWin-Arrow to CtrlAltWin-Arrow to avoid collision
              with the new "Move to Edge" HotKeys.
    - CHANGE: Moved the HotKey definitions for dragging the mouse into the appropriate group (Miscellaneous).
    - CHANGE: Changed key for "Toggle Minimized" from Win-M to Ctrl-Win-M.
    - CHANGE: Changed Preview Clipboard (Win-V) to indicate if the data is complex and therefore cannot be previewed.
    - CHANGE: Added back previous error checking when running Snipping Tool (Win-PrintScreen) for Windows 2008 but also
              added checking for Windows 2012.
    - REMOVE: Deleted the hkCustom HotKey group (and configuration setting), moving the only entry into the hkText group.
HotStrings
    - NEW   : Added new fractions for 1/6, 1/5, 2/8, 2/6, 2/5, 2/4, 3/6, 4/8, 3/5, 4/6, 6/8, 4/5 and 5/6.
    - CHANGE: Changed trigger for fractions to start with some type of separator ("3 1/2" instead of "31/2").
    - CHANGE: Changed several HotStrings (@addr, @ip, @me, @sig) to be case-sensitive.
    - CHANGE: Changed how fraction HotStrings are defined; they now use hotString().
    - CHANGE: Changed how date and time HotStrings are defined; they now use hotString().
Variables
    - NEW   : Added "@dob" to use the new variable MY_DOB.
    - NEW   : Added "@pw" to use the new variable MY_PASSWORD. The value is encrypted using the same function as
              CtrlShift-E and will be unencrypted when this HotString is used.
    - NEW   : Added "@w" to use the new variable MY_WORK_EMAIL.
    - NEW   : Missing MY_xxxxxx variables (in HotScriptVariables.ahk) will now be automatically added with a default
              value if they are missing. This means that there is no longer a need to manually edit this file to add
              new variables that will be supported in future versions of HotScript, but this file will still need to
              be edited by the user to provide the appropriate real values to be used.
    - NEW   : Added new configuration setting (enableHsVariables) for enabling/disabling HotStrings for HotScript
              variables (MY_xxxxxx).
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Added "Historical changes" to the HotScript tray menu.
    - CHANGE: Huge refactor of the help screen!  To switch between tabs with keyboard use Ctrl-PgUp / Ctrl-PgDn. Press
              ESC to close.
    - CHANGE: Changed configuration setting for enableAutoUpdate from false to true.
    - CHANGE: Added "#32770" (Open/Save dialog) as a member of the Explorer group.
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - getActiveProcessID()
                - getActiveProcessName()
                - getDateString()
                - getDayString()
                - getDddString()
                - getDtmsString()
                - getDtsString()
                - getMmmString()
                - getMonthString()
                - getNowString()
                - getTimeString()
                - getTmsString()
                - isActiveDos()
                - isCalculatorNotActive()
                - moveToEdge()
                - pad()
                - parseTemplate()
    - NEW   : Added support for user-defined initialization function called userInit(). Because of how AutoHotKey works,
              do not define HotKeys or HotStrings within the userInit() function. These should be placed in
              HotScriptKeys.ahk or HotScriptStrings.ahk. Failure to do so will almost certainly cause significant
              parts of HotScript to stop functioning.
    - CHANGE: Modified toBool() to return true if the value is a number and greater than zero.
    - CHANGE: Modified hotString() to use any return value from a named function as the replacement text.
    - CHANGE: Renamed showDebugVar() to showVariable().
    - CHANGE: Improved output of showVariable().
    - CHANGE: Improved output of toString().
    - CHANGE: Enhanced output of templateHtml().
    - CHANGE: Modified resizeTo() for Windows 10. This affects all window movement HotKeys. Windows 10 puts transparent
              borders around non-maxmimied windows along the left, right and bottom of a window. When these windows line
              up next to each other, "gaps" appear which show whatever is underneath the windows. I found this quite
              annoying, so the math was changed for Windows 10 to accommodate these gaps. The coordinates are adjusted
              as follows:  X -6, Y -1, Width +16, Height +9.


Differences in 1.20151030.2
===========================
HotStrings
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with the "bi##" HotString not displaying the ##.


Differences in 1.20151030.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-D to create a folder (directory) in Explorer or on the desktop.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-F to create a file in Explorer or on the desktop.
    - NEW   : Added Alt-Win-D to open a DOS window to the current path in Explorer, if it is the active Window.
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Improved the ability to launch Explorer via Win-X.
              Now it will activate an existing window, if it exists but is not focused.
              The default starting location will be the root of the SystemDrive (as defined by Windows) instead of C:\
    - CHANGE: Modified runDos() to accept a location (path), which will be the active directory when DOS is executed.
    - CHANGE: Increased sleep time from 100ms to 250ms when launching an application to allow more time for the window
              to exist. This may help with certain issues where the application is launched, but is not activated
              (focused).
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - createNewInExplorer()
                - createNewOnDesktop()
                - getExplorerPath()
                - getUniqueNewName()
                - selectInExplorer()
                - selectOnDesktop()


Differences in 1.20151027.1
===========================
HotStrings
    - NEW   : Added "@me" to use the new variable MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added "@sig" to use the new variable MY_SIGNATURE
    - CHANGE: Internal changes to "@ip" to allow it to be easily overridden with a custom function
    - NEW   : Added "#/#%", which divides two numbers and returns the result as a percent
    - NEW   : Added "#%#", which returns the percentage of the first number in relation to the second number
    - NEW   : Added "lmk"
    - NEW   : Added "vg"
Variables
    - NEW   : Added MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added MY_SIGNATURE
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Added missing reference to "@#" HotString on the help screen
    - CHANGE: Minor internal changes to how the headers of the HotScript-*.ahk include scripts are written
    - CHANGE: Added additional information to the headers of HotScript-Strings.ahk to include dynamic HotStrings
    - REMOVE: GetKeyState() because it now conflicts with AutoHotKey's internal function with the same name
    - REMOVE: getHotKeySections() because it was an obsolete function from a very old version
    - CHANGE: Minor change within hotString() to call addHotString() only if any conditional function returns true
    - CHANGE: Minor renaming of variables and optimization within hotString()
    - CHANGE: Added a "." to the end of some of the aliases on the help screen to signify that an ending character is
              needed


Differences in 1.20151018.1
===========================
- Added configuration flag to disabling auto-updates (auto-update is on by default - may be disabled via
  enableAutoUpdate in the INI).
- Added ability to create an auto-startup link (may be disabled via enableAutoStart in the INI)
- Fixed issue with ask() returning any value entered even if the user closed dialog, click cancel or pressed Escape
- Removed warning message about being unable to obtain version information if an internet connection is not available
  at startup
- Made changes that may have finally corrected intermittent issues with pasting text to a DOS window
- Swapped Win-6 and Win-8 to allow Win-8 and Win-9 to be next grouped together
- Added new functions:
    - isDirectory()
    - isFile()
    - isUNC()
- Added smarter control to Win-G to allow running of files/directories (if they exist) or UNC paths
- Added hotkey to launch the HotScript homepage (Win-0)
- Added menu item to launch the HotScript homepage from the system tray icon
- Fixed a known limitation of being unable to use a tab as an ending character to a dynamic HotString
    - This was only an issue for HotStrings that would be replaced (rather than just appending text)
    - Because some editors can be configured to insert (a variable number of) spaces instead of a tab, it
      was not easily knowable how much backspacing was required in order to erase the trigger string.
    - While this is slightly slower than normal now (only when using a tab), it is working correctly.
        - The reason for it being slow is that the text entered must be selected one character at a time
          until the start of the trigger can be found.
- Removed unwanted menu items from the system tray icon
- Added status (enabled or suspended) to system tray icon tooltip
- Delete downloaded installer after upgrading
- Added new global variable (defined in HotScriptVariables.ahk)
    - MY_PHONE        (trigger by the HotString "@#")
        - This will need to be added manually (by the user - you!) until I can determine a way of SAFELY adding it to
          existing files


Differences in 1.20150910.2
===========================
- Minor bug fix

Differences in 1.20150910.1
===========================
- Minor bug fixes
    - Fixed issue with pasting large text in a DOS window. There is no longer a size limit
    - Increased delay to select the last known window when restoring previously minimized windows (via Win-M)


Differences in 1.20150907.4
===========================

Differences in 1.20150907.3
===========================
- Added hotkey (Win-M) for toggling windows minimized/restored
- Improved scrolling within a DOS window for Page Up/Page Down functionality - it now scrolls exactly one page
- Added scrolling to top or bottom of DOS window (Ctrl-Home / Ctrl-End)


Differences in 1.20150907.1
===========================
- Started preparation of changing HotStrings from internally hard-coded to be user configurable
    - this means HotStrings will now be defined via a regex, which adds tremendous power
    - while it can also mean slightly more work to setup very complex HotStrings, now many more things can be achieved
    - this functionality is only in the beginning stages - much more work needs to be done here
- Added version checking and simple updating (at startup/reload) for both AutoHotKey and HotScript
    - prompts the user with the current/new versions and asks for permission to download/install the new version
    - new configuration setting to disable version checking (enableVersionCheck)
- Added version checking of HotScript at startup/reload

- Changed several marker symbols:
    - (Always-on-top) from [†] to [ᛂ]
    - (Click-through) from [‡] to [ᚾ]
    = (Transparent)   from [±] to [≡]
- Added new marker [፨ ] for (Pinned), which is a feature that will be implemented in a future release
- Added a warning (about instability) when pasting large amounts of text (> 4K) into a DOS window
- Fixed a small error on the quick help screen - "Resize to NE" and "Resize to NW" were reversed
- Added new functions:
    - getVarType()
    - urlToVar()


Differences in 20131211.2 through 1.20150821.2

- Fixed HotStrings not working in a DOS window (paste vs SendInput)
- Added ability to change window transparency
- Added ability to click-through a window
- Added @ip HotString
- Added common fractions (1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 2/3, 3/4, 7/8)
