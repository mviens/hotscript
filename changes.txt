===========================
Functions
    - NEW   : Added support for menus to automatically include an icon if the corresponding function name is
              defined. A different icon can show for when the function is defined as well as for when it is
              not. Within the primary menu object, use the "runIcon" and "warnIcon" boolean flags to enable
              displaying the icons.
    - CHANGE: Fixed a minor cosmetic issue in menuBuilder() where the primary menu color would increment by
              one for each time the menu was shown instead of always showing the first defined color.


Differences in 1.20161228.1
===========================
HotStrings
    - NEW   : Add a constant for menu colors. (hs.const.MENU_COLORS) There are seven pre-defined colors.
    - CHANGE: Fixed comment header for Perl and SQL to use the correct indentation.
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Modified the creation of HotScriptFunctions.ahk, HotScriptKeys.ahk, HotScriptStrings.ahk and
              HotScriptVariables.ahk to use correct Windows line ending characters (CRLF) instead of Unix/Linux
              line-endings (LF).
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - isArray()
                - isEmpty()
                - menuBuilder()
                - menuHandler()
                - toSafeName()
    - CHANGE: Modified toString() to use the correct brackets for the object type, when applicable:
              "[]" for array, "{}" for objects and "<>" for all other objects. Note: empty arrays cannot be
              properly detected and will instead show as empty objects.
    

Differences in 1.20161014.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - CHANGE: Modified the behavior of checkVersions(), because as of version 1.1.24.02, AutoHotKey has changed the
              filename of their installation file. This was causing HotScript to fail when it detected a new version
              of AutoHotKey to be installed. Previously, new version of AutoHotKey were named like
              "AutoHotkey112401_Install.exe" but are now available as "AutoHotkey_1.1.24.02_setup.exe". For existing
              users of HotScript, the best solution for now is to manually download and install the new version of
              AutoHotKey and then manually install the new version of HotScript. While this should only affect a
              small number of users, it is inconvenient. This should no longer happen regardless of the name of the
              AutoHotKey installation. Further verification checks are being done to validate that any new version of
              AutoHotKey that is downloaded is a valid file. 
    - CHANGE: Changed action for DOS HotKey Alt-Up (or Alt-.) to run "cd .." instead of "cd..".  Linux/Unix wants the
              space between the 'd' and '.' whereas DOS did not care. This is helpful for DOS windows running SSH to
              access a Linux/Unix server.
    - CHANGE: Added some additional checking with Delete Word (Ctrl-D) to determine is Microsoft's Visual Studio Code
              is the active Window. If so, need to treat it differently because Ctrl-C, from getSelectedText(), will
              copy the entire line if there is no selection. This is a temporary workaround until a better solution
              can be found.
Functions
    - CHANGE: Renamed findOrRunByExe() to findAndRun()
    - CHANGE: Moved error logic from hkActionWindowsSnip() to findAndRun()
    - REMOVE: Removed unnecessary functions:
                - StringLower()
                - StringUpper()
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Made a minor change to the help screen for to indicate that no additional modifier key is required for
              "Row 1" on HotKeys that resize the window to 3x4, 4x3 and 4x4.


Differences in 1.20160711.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - CHANGE: Restored original functionality of Alt-Down within Windows Explorer. Previously it was trying to execute
              the functionality for "Move line down", but this made no sense in Explorer.
    - CHANGE: Restored original functionality of Alt-Up within Windows Explorer. Previously it was trying to execute
              the functionality for "Move line up", but this made no sense in Explorer.
    - CHANGE: Restored original functionality of Ctrl-Shift-E within Windows Explorer. Previously it was trying to
              execute the functionality for "Encrypt text", but this made no sense in Explorer.
    - CHANGE: Restored original functionality of Ctrl-Shift-N within Windows Explorer. Previously it was trying to
              execute the functionality for "Auto-Number (1)", but this made no sense in Explorer.
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Modified to run with admin priviledges because of a few small writes to the registry. This eliminates
              the need to modify the shortcut to allow access.
    - CHANGE: The Windows link (shortcut) file will now only be created if it does not exist instead of every time
              HotScript is executed or reloaded.
    - CHANGE: Added missing reference to "$" in the documentation within HotScriptKeys.ahk.
    - CHANGE: Fixed minor issue in the documentation within HotScriptKeys.ahk that incorrectly referred to HotStrings.
    - CHANGE: Modified the URL pointing to GitHub from "release" to "master". This should have no effect as both
              branches are kept in sync. Eventually "release" will be phased out and a new "beta" branch will be
              available for anyone interested in using the latest and greatest development version (which is what I
              use everyday). This will be an opt-in setting eventually.
    - CHANGE: Modified the help screen from "Level 1-4" to read "Row 1-4" to help clarify the meaning as the optional
              modifier keys for resizing 3x4, 4x3 and 4x4.
    - REMOVE: Removed some old, commented code.
Functions
    - CHANGE: Modified message() to accept "title", "options" and "timeout". These have default values, so no changes
              are required for existing usages.


Differences in 1.20160710.2
===========================
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with auto-update not working correctly.


Differences in 1.20160710.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : Added new window resizing dimensions: 1x3, 2x3, 3x1, 3x2, 3x4, 4x3, and 4x4.
    - NEW   : Added new window resizing options for resize to max height or max width. With multiple monitors, these
              functions will toggle between resizing between the current monitor and all monitors. The HotKeys are
              Shift-Win-Left-Right for resizing to max width and Shift-Win-Up-Down for resixzing to max height. It is
              necessary to press both arrow keys SIMULTANEOUSLY or this HotKey will not be triggered. This is different
              than the existing HotKeys resizing to 2x2, where you may press Shift-Win-Arrow1 then Arrow2 separately.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-MouseWheelUp and Ctrl-MouseWheelDown to scroll horizontally left/right, respectively.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-D to delete from the current cursor position to the next word. It is important to note that
              different applications treat Ctrl-Shift-RightArrow somewhat differently. As much as possible, consistency
              was implemented to overcome this. To see some of the differences between applications, see the comments
              in hkTextDeleteWord().
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with Ctrl-Delete where it was not issuing the correct keystrokes to delete the text.
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Delete (Delete to end-of-line) to help screen. This HotKey had been implemented for quite a
              while, but was erroneously omitted from the help screen.
    - CHANGE: Modified wait time of ClipWait() from 0.5 seconds to 0.05 seconds. This increases the speed of several
              operations like swapping selection with the clipboard, appending to the clipboard, getting the selected
              text and pasting text. These same operations are used by other functions as well as some HotKeys.
    - CHANGE: Throughout HotScript, when searching for named applications, they are no longer case-sensitive.
    - CHANGE: The help screen is now created (internally) only once instead of everytime it is displayed.
    - CHANGE: The help screen will now be displayed on the active monitor instead of only the primary monitor.
    - CHANGE: Minor code cleanup and changes for consistency.
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - extractLocationAndResize()
                - getSelf()
                - getStackTrace()
                - horizontalScroll()
                - isActiveCalculator()
                - isWord()
    - CHANGE: Modified getVarType() to better distinguish between a string and a function.
    - CHANGE: Modified runTarget() to wait for the application for 1 second instead of indefinitely.
    - CHANGE: Modified toString() to more accurately display the name of a function. Also fixed a small bug where
              labels were not being processed correctly.
    - CHANGE: Renamed isCalculatorNotActive() to isNotActiveCalculator().
    - REMOVE: Removed resizeTo(). It was replaced with extractLocationAndResize().


Differences in 1.20160619.1
===========================
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Added brief (2 second) notification that HotScript is being upgraded to a new version. This is only
              applicable if "enableAutoUpdate" is set to true. This will take effect for versions later than this one.
    - NEW   : After upgrading to a new version of HotScript, a dialog will be displayed asking if the list of
              changes should be displayed. This is only applicable if "enableVersionCheck" is set to true. This will
              take effect for versions later than this one.
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue broken in 1.20160618.1 where user configuration values would be incorrectly removed from
              HotScriptUser.ini.

Differences in 1.20160618.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : All HotKeys are now defined using hotKey() instead of the manner expected by AHK.
    - NEW   : Added Win-/ to display information about the current window.
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with Alt-Shift-, and Alt-Shift-. not working.
    - CHANGE: Added 768x1024 to the Quick Resolution options.
    - CHANGE: Added a custom option to the Quick Resolution.
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Modified auto-update to download to a temporary filename instead of HotScript.ahk and to test the
              integrity of the file. This was necessary because occassionally GitHub may be unavailable and the
              downloaded file would actually be GitHub's HTML error page.
    - NEW   : Added new configuration value to save the last date that a new version was checked for. This allows
              HotScript to now only search for new version once per day instead of every reload.
    - CHANGE: Increased MaxHotkeysPerInterval (currently every 2 seconds) from 200 to 500.
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with enableHsVariables not being saved properly.
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with some configuration values being saved to HotScriptUser.ini when they should not.
    - CHANGE: Refactored the code for creating the help screen to only generate the content once, which should
              allow the screen to not only be displayed faster, but also may fix the issue with the help screen
              randomly appearing as blank.
    - CHANGE: Miscellaneous code cleanup.
    - REMOVE: Removed obsolete configuration values for "inputBoxFieldFont" and "inputBoxOptions".
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - centerControls()
                - clipboardAppend()
                - debugVar()
                - hotKey()
                - showWindowInfo()
    - CHANGE: Refactored ask() to support multi-line input as well as regular or monospace font.
    - CHANGE: Refactored registerHotkey() into hotKey(), with better support for conditions and parameters.
    - CHANGE: Modified centerWindow() to be able to specify the monitor number for which to center the window.
    - CHANGE: Modified checkVersions() only execute once per day.
    - CHANGE: Added an "options" parameter to FileRead().
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with getIndent1() sometimes returning an empty string. It now will always return some value.
    - CHANGE: Added an parameter to resizeWindow() to indicate if the window should be centered after resizing it.
    - CHANGE: Refactored toString() to eliminate the depth restriction for objects and to indicate if a value is a
              function or label.
    - REMOVE: Removed the wrapper function StringReplace(), because AHK has a built-in function called StrReplace().
    - REMOVE: Removed old migration code for version 20131211.2.
    - REMOVE: Removed isWindow().
    - REMOVE: Removed resizeToResolution(). It was redundant to resizeWindow().


Differences in 1.20160406.3
===========================
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with endless loop restarting/updating. The version file was updated but the internal version
              was not, so HotScript thought there was always a newer version to be downloaded.


Differences in 1.20160406.2
===========================
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Added a constant for a default indent of 4 spaces. (hs.const.INDENT)
Functions
    - CHANGE: Modified getIndent() to check if the active window is a DOS window. If so, it will use the new default
              constant value of 4 spaces, otherwise it will try to determine the indent level from the active window.


Differences in 1.20160406.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-Shift-A to sort the selected text as case-sensitive in ascending order.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-Shift-D to sort the selected text as case-sensitive in descending order.
    - CHANGE: Changed Ctrl-Shift-A to (sort the selected text in ascending order) to be as case-insensitive.
    - CHANGE: Changed Ctrl-Shift-D to (sort the selected text in descending order) to be as case-insensitive.
HotStrings
    - CHANGE: Changed the auto-correct HotString of "[a-z]L" to now be restricted to a word boundary, so that typing
              values such as "StrLen" will no longer cause the HotString to be triggered.
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Added missing HTML tag "thead" to HotString help screen.
    - CHANGE: Minor code cleanup.
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - compareStrAscNoCase()
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with hsCodeFunction(), used by the "func(" HotString, not replacing "func" with "function".
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with hsCommentHeaderPerl() leaving the cursor on the wrong line.
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with hsCommentHeaderSql() leaving the cursor on the wrong line.
    - CHANGE: Fixed getIndent() where if a line started contained more than only whitespace, the wrong "indent" value
              was being used.
    - CHANGE: Numerous minor refinements to several of the hsXxxYyy() functions to produce better output, especially
              within editors that have varying degrees of sophistication (or a complete lack of, such as Notepad).
    - CHANGE: Modified getIndent() to handle different editors, producing a much more reliable determination of the
              current indentation level.


Differences in 1.20160404.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - CHANGE: Win-Pause was incorrectly wrapped by the "enableHkMisc" variable.  If this variable was disabled, the
              Win-Pause key (which pauses HotScript) would not be enabled. This is the only hotkey that is hard-coded
              and cannot be user-modified. While the Win-Pause key may be overridden but some other function, it is not
              (currently) possible to reassign HotScript's pause function to another key combination due to the
              restrictions of AHK's "Suspend" command.
HotStrings
    - CHANGE: Changed the auto-correct HotString of "cL" to now include all drive letters.
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Added a link on the help screen to open the HotScript home page in the default browser.
    - NEW   : Added an option on the tray icon to display the help screen.
    - CHANGE: Refactored all internal HotStrings to use hotString() instead of the mechanism used by AHK. This will
              help with some future changes as well as reducing the amount of code. It should now be possible to define
              any HotString using hotString(), which can have much more flexibility than offered by AHK. I strongly
              recommend comverting your existing user-defined HotStrings to use this new method. When using
              hotString(), addHotString() no longer needs to be called to update the metrics.
    - CHANGE: Rearranged the help screen for HotStrings.
    - CHANGE: Trying to fix a bug when showing the help screen. Randomly the screen will show without the text
              displayed. If you click and drag with the mouse, the text will show. Still working on this issue, but it
              seems "better".
Variables
    - NEW   : Added "replaceMode" to "hs.const" object.
    - CHANGE: Made the $ variable to be truly global.  Do NOT use this variable name for your own values.
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - getIndent()
                - getIndent1()
                - hsCodeBlock()
                - hsCodeElseIf()
                - hsCodeFunction()
                - hsCodeIfElse()
                - hsCodeStringFormat()
                - hsCodeSwitch()
                - hsCodeSysOut()
                - hsCommentHeaderHtml()
                - hsCommentHeaderJava()
                - hsCommentHeaderPerl()
                - hsCommentHeaderSql()
                - hsHtmlA()
                - hsHtmlComment()
                - hsHtmlHeader()
                - hsHtmlHtml()
                - hsHtmlInput()
                - hsHtmlLink()
                - hsHtmlList()
                - hsHtmlOptGroup()
                - hsHtmlSelect()
                - hsHtmlSource()
                - hsHtmlStyle()
                - hsHtmlTable()
                - hsHtmlTagAbbr()
                - hsHtmlTagBlock()
                - hsHtmlTagFor()
                - hsHtmlTagNoEndChar()
                - hsHtmlTagSimple()
                - hsHtmlTagSrc()
                - hsHtmlTextarea()
                - hsHtmlTr()
                - hsJiraCode()
                - hsJiraColor()
                - hsJiraNoFormat()
                - hsJiraPanel()
                - hsJiraQuote()
                - hsJiraSpecialPanel()
                - hsJiraTable()
                - hsJira()
    - CHANGE: Swapped position of "clear" and "condition" in the function defintion of hotString().
    - CHANGE: Renamed "hsBackInX()" to "hsAliasBackInX()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "sendJiraCode()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "sendJiraPanel()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "sendJiraSpecialPanel()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Renamed "templateJiraTable()" to "()".
    - CHANGE: Minor change to prepended text for debug().
    - REMOVE: Removed obsolete function hkToStr().


Differences in 1.20160326.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-C to copy/append text to the clipboard. This does NOT work for files.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-V to swap the currently selected text into the clipboard, replacing the selected text with
              the previous contents of the clipboard.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-X to cut/append text to the clipboard. This does NOT work for files.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Win-Arrow to move the current window to the edge of the screen, without resizing it.
    - NEW   : Added Win-M to run Character Map.
    - NEW   : Added Alt-Win-H to run Windows Explorer in the HotScript folder.
    - NEW   : Added Alt-Win-S to run Windows Explorer in the Startup folder.
    - NEW   : Added Win-` to run DebugView.
    - CHANGE: Modified the HotKeys for dragging the mouse from CtrlWin-Arrow to CtrlAltWin-Arrow to avoid collision
              with the new "Move to Edge" HotKeys.
    - CHANGE: Moved the HotKey definitions for dragging the mouse into the appropriate group (Miscellaneous).
    - CHANGE: Changed key for "Toggle Minimized" from Win-M to Ctrl-Win-M.
    - CHANGE: Changed Preview Clipboard (Win-V) to indicate if the data is complex and therefore cannot be previewed.
    - CHANGE: Added back previous error checking when running Snipping Tool (Win-PrintScreen) for Windows 2008 but also
              added checking for Windows 2012.
    - REMOVE: Deleted the hkCustom HotKey group (and configuration setting), moving the only entry into the hkText
              group.
HotStrings
    - NEW   : Added new fractions for 1/6, 1/5, 2/8, 2/6, 2/5, 2/4, 3/6, 4/8, 3/5, 4/6, 6/8, 4/5 and 5/6.
    - CHANGE: Changed trigger for fractions to start with some type of separator ("3 1/2" instead of "31/2").
    - CHANGE: Changed several HotStrings (@addr, @ip, @me, @sig) to be case-sensitive.
    - CHANGE: Changed how fraction HotStrings are defined; they now use hotString().
    - CHANGE: Changed how date and time HotStrings are defined; they now use hotString().
Variables
    - NEW   : Added "@dob" to use the new variable MY_DOB.
    - NEW   : Added "@pw" to use the new variable MY_PASSWORD. The value is encrypted using the same function as
              CtrlShift-E and will be unencrypted when this HotString is used.
    - NEW   : Added "@w" to use the new variable MY_WORK_EMAIL.
    - NEW   : Missing MY_xxxxxx variables (in HotScriptVariables.ahk) will now be automatically added with a default
              value if they are missing. This means that there is no longer a need to manually edit this file to add
              new variables that will be supported in future versions of HotScript, but this file will still need to
              be edited by the user to provide the appropriate real values to be used.
    - NEW   : Added new configuration setting (enableHsVariables) for enabling/disabling HotStrings for HotScript
              variables (MY_xxxxxx).
Miscellaneous
    - NEW   : Added "Historical changes" to the HotScript tray menu.
    - CHANGE: Huge refactor of the help screen!  To switch between tabs with keyboard use Ctrl-PgUp / Ctrl-PgDn. Press
              ESC to close.
    - CHANGE: Changed configuration setting for enableAutoUpdate from false to true.
    - CHANGE: Added "#32770" (Open/Save dialog) as a member of the Explorer group.
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - getActiveProcessID()
                - getActiveProcessName()
                - getDateString()
                - getDayString()
                - getDddString()
                - getDtmsString()
                - getDtsString()
                - getMmmString()
                - getMonthString()
                - getNowString()
                - getTimeString()
                - getTmsString()
                - isActiveDos()
                - isCalculatorNotActive()
                - moveToEdge()
                - pad()
                - parseTemplate()
    - NEW   : Added support for user-defined initialization function called userInit(). Because of how AutoHotKey
              works, do not define HotKeys or HotStrings within the userInit() function. These should be placed in
              HotScriptKeys.ahk or HotScriptStrings.ahk. Failure to do so will almost certainly cause significant
              parts of HotScript to stop functioning.
    - CHANGE: Modified toBool() to return true if the value is a number and greater than zero.
    - CHANGE: Modified hotString() to use any return value from a named function as the replacement text.
    - CHANGE: Renamed showDebugVar() to showVariable().
    - CHANGE: Improved output of showVariable().
    - CHANGE: Improved output of toString().
    - CHANGE: Enhanced output of templateHtml().
    - CHANGE: Modified resizeTo() for Windows 10. This affects all window movement HotKeys. Windows 10 puts transparent
              borders around non-maxmimied windows along the left, right and bottom of a window. When these windows
              line up next to each other, "gaps" appear which show whatever is underneath the windows. I found this
              quite annoying, so the math was changed for Windows 10 to accommodate these gaps. The coordinates are
              adjusted as follows:  X -6, Y -1, Width +16, Height +9.


Differences in 1.20151030.2
===========================
HotStrings
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with the "bi##" HotString not displaying the ##.


Differences in 1.20151030.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-D to create a folder (directory) in Explorer or on the desktop.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-F to create a file in Explorer or on the desktop.
    - NEW   : Added Alt-Win-D to open a DOS window to the current path in Explorer, if it is the active Window.
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Improved the ability to launch Explorer via Win-X.
              Now it will activate an existing window, if it exists but is not focused.
              The default starting location will be the root of the SystemDrive (as defined by Windows) instead of C:\
    - CHANGE: Modified runDos() to accept a location (path), which will be the active directory when DOS is executed.
    - CHANGE: Increased sleep time from 100ms to 250ms when launching an application to allow more time for the window
              to exist. This may help with certain issues where the application is launched, but is not activated
              (focused).
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - createNewInExplorer()
                - createNewOnDesktop()
                - getExplorerPath()
                - getUniqueNewName()
                - selectInExplorer()
                - selectOnDesktop()


Differences in 1.20151027.1
===========================
HotStrings
    - NEW   : Added "@me" to use the new variable MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added "@sig" to use the new variable MY_SIGNATURE
    - CHANGE: Internal changes to "@ip" to allow it to be easily overridden with a custom function
    - NEW   : Added "#/#%", which divides two numbers and returns the result as a percent
    - NEW   : Added "#%#", which returns the percentage of the first number in relation to the second number
    - NEW   : Added "lmk"
    - NEW   : Added "vg"
Variables
    - NEW   : Added MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added MY_SIGNATURE
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Added missing reference to "@#" HotString on the help screen
    - CHANGE: Minor internal changes to how the headers of the HotScript-*.ahk include scripts are written
    - CHANGE: Added additional information to the headers of HotScript-Strings.ahk to include dynamic HotStrings
    - REMOVE: GetKeyState() because it now conflicts with AutoHotKey's internal function with the same name
    - REMOVE: getHotKeySections() because it was an obsolete function from a very old version
    - CHANGE: Minor change within hotString() to call addHotString() only if any conditional function returns true
    - CHANGE: Minor renaming of variables and optimization within hotString()
    - CHANGE: Added a "." to the end of some of the aliases on the help screen to signify that an ending character is
              needed


Differences in 1.20151018.1
===========================
- Added configuration flag to disabling auto-updates (auto-update is on by default - may be disabled via
  enableAutoUpdate in the INI).
- Added ability to create an auto-startup link (may be disabled via enableAutoStart in the INI)
- Fixed issue with ask() returning any value entered even if the user closed dialog, click cancel or pressed Escape
- Removed warning message about being unable to obtain version information if an internet connection is not available
  at startup
- Made changes that may have finally corrected intermittent issues with pasting text to a DOS window
- Swapped Win-6 and Win-8 to allow Win-8 and Win-9 to be next grouped together
- Added new functions:
    - isDirectory()
    - isFile()
    - isUNC()
- Added smarter control to Win-G to allow running of files/directories (if they exist) or UNC paths
- Added hotkey to launch the HotScript homepage (Win-0)
- Added menu item to launch the HotScript homepage from the system tray icon
- Fixed a known limitation of being unable to use a tab as an ending character to a dynamic HotString
    - This was only an issue for HotStrings that would be replaced (rather than just appending text)
    - Because some editors can be configured to insert (a variable number of) spaces instead of a tab, it
      was not easily knowable how much backspacing was required in order to erase the trigger string.
    - While this is slightly slower than normal now (only when using a tab), it is working correctly.
        - The reason for it being slow is that the text entered must be selected one character at a time
          until the start of the trigger can be found.
- Removed unwanted menu items from the system tray icon
- Added status (enabled or suspended) to system tray icon tooltip
- Delete downloaded installer after upgrading
- Added new global variable (defined in HotScriptVariables.ahk)
    - MY_PHONE        (trigger by the HotString "@#")
        - This will need to be added manually (by the user - you!) until I can determine a way of SAFELY adding it to
          existing files

===========================
- Minor bug fix

- Added scrolling to top or bottom of DOS window (Ctrl-Home / Ctrl-End)


Differences in 1.20150907.1
===========================
- Started preparation of changing HotStrings from internally hard-coded to be user configurable
    - this means HotStrings will now be defined via a regex, which adds tremendous power
    - while it can also mean slightly more work to setup very complex HotStrings, now many more things can be achieved
    - this functionality is only in the beginning stages - much more work needs to be done here
- Added version checking and simple updating (at startup/reload) for both AutoHotKey and HotScript

- Added ability to click-through a window
- Added @ip HotString
- Added common fractions (1/8, 1/4, 1/3, 3/8, 1/2, 5/8, 2/3, 3/4, 7/8)
