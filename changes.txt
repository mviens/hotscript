Differences in 1.20151030.2
===========================
HotStrings
    - CHANGE: Fixed issue with the "bi##" HotString not displaying the ##.


Differences in 1.20151030.1
===========================
HotKeys
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-D to create a folder (directory) in Explorer or on the desktop.
    - NEW   : Added Ctrl-Alt-F to create a file in Explorer or on the desktop.
    - NEW   : Added Alt-Win-D to open a DOS window to the current path in Explorer, if it is the active Window.
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Improved the ability to launch Explorer via Win-X.
              Now it will activate an existing window, if it exists but is not focused.
              The default starting location will be the root of the SystemDrive (as defined by Windows) instead of C:\
    - CHANGE: Modified runDos() to accept a location (path), which will be the active directory when DOS is executed.
    - CHANGE: Increased sleep time from 100ms to 250ms when launching an application to allow more time for the window to exist.
              This may help with certain issues where the application is launched, but is not activated (focused).
Functions
    - NEW   : Added the following new functions:
                - createNewInExplorer()
                - createNewOnDesktop()
                - getExplorerPath()
                - getUniqueNewName()
                - selectInExplorer()
                - selectOnDesktop()


Differences in 1.20151027.1
===========================
HotStrings
    - NEW   : Added "@me" to use the new variable MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added "@sig" to use the new variable MY_SIGNATURE
    - CHANGE: Internal changes to "@ip" to allow it to be easily overridden with a custom function
    - NEW   : Added "#/#%", which divides two numbers and returns the result as a percent
    - NEW   : Added "#%#", which returns the percentage of the first number in relation to the second number
    - NEW   : Added "lmk"
    - NEW   : Added "vg"
Variables
    - NEW   : Added MY_NAME
    - NEW   : Added MY_SIGNATURE
Miscellaneous
    - CHANGE: Added missing reference to "@#" hotstring on the help screen
    - CHANGE: Minor internal changes to how the headers of the HotScript-*.ahk include scripts are written
    - CHANGE: Added additional information to the headers of HotScript-Strings.ahk to include dynamic hotstrings
    - REMOVE: GetKeyState() because it now conflicts with AutoHotKey's internal function with the same name
    - REMOVE: getHotKeySections() because it was an obsolete function from a very old version
    - CHANGE: Minor change within hotString() to call addHotString() only if any conditional function returns true
    - CHANGE: Minor renaming of variables and optimization within hotString()
    - CHANGE: Added a "." to the end of some of the aliases on the help screen to signify that an ending character is needed


Differences in 1.20151018.1
===========================
- Added configuration flag to disabling auto-updates (auto-update is on by default - may be disabled via enableAutoUpdate in the INI).
- Added ability to create an auto-startup link (may be disabled via enableAutoStart in the INI)
- Fixed issue with ask() returning any value entered even if the user closed dialog, click cancel or pressed Escape
- Removed warning message about being unable to obtain version information if an internet connection is not available at startup
- Made changes that may have finally corrected intermittent issues with pasting text to a DOS window
- Swapped Win-6 and Win-8 to allow Win-8 and Win-9 to be next grouped together
- Added new functions:
    - isDirectory()
    - isFile()
    - isUNC()
- Added smarter control to Win-G to allow running of files/directories (if they exist) or UNC paths
- Added hotkey to launch the HotScript homepage (Win-0)
- Added menu item to launch the HotScript homepage from the system tray icon
- Fixed a known limitation of being unable to use a tab as an ending character to a dynamic hotstring
    - This was only an issue for hotstrings that would be replaced (rather than just appending text)
    - Because some editors can be configured to insert (a variable number of) spaces instead of a tab, it
      was not easily knowable how much backspacing was required in order to erase the trigger string.
    - While this is slightly slower than normal now (only when using a tab), it is working correctly.
        - The reason for it being slow is that the text entered must be selected one character at a time
          until the start of the trigger can be found.
- Removed unwanted menu items from the system tray icon
- Added status (enabled or suspended) to system tray icon tooltip
- Delete downloaded installer after upgrading
- Added new global variable (defined in HotScriptVariables.ahk)
    - MY_PHONE        (trigger by the hotstring "@#")
        - This will need to be added manually (by the user - you!) until I can determine a way of SAFELY adding it to existing files

Differences in 1.20150907.1
===========================
