## Status

Documentation is being enhanced but is lagging behind the actual development of HotScript. We know it is important and are working on it. The current [user manual](UserManual.md) is outdated and will be replaced with a full wiki describing every feature of HotScript and will also include a fully documented API. Please check the forum for updates.

### Roadmap 
HotScript is continuously growing. The wishlist is huge, containing several hundred new features. 

## Donate

Please consider donating towards the future development and support of HotScript.

## User Comments

**Paul P.**
> The elegance of what you have built here is in the simplicity of being able to use it.

**Dave V.**
> I can honestly say that if I have to go without HotScript I will be a very unhappy camper. The custom tasks that I have it do make my life so much simpler. Just being able to change to all caps or titles alone is worth having it. I use it every day, all day. It would be like telling me I can no longer drive and have to go back to horse and carriage.

> The amount of time HotScript saves me during the week is remarkable.

**J.P.**
> I have waited for years for Microsoft to provide some of these features.

**KB**
> I use it ALL the time.  Why wouldn't you?
